                    Their paths first crossed as undergrads in the US, Anjali living an artistic life in Brooklyn,
                    Jayant being an engineering nerd in upstate New York. They would meet occasionally, when Jayant was
                    transiting through NYC or when the fellowship supporting their education would hold its annual
                    conference. They became fast friends, but never more.

                <p class="body">
                    Conversations and meetings were few and far between after undergrad. Anjali hit the hustle of the
                    design consultant world, chugging coffee, jet setting across the world. Jayant moved to the West
                    Coast, still studying and also chugging coffee but the hipstery, funky kind.

                    The fateful reconnection is a tale as old as the modern European summer fling. Jayant was living and
                    working in Berlin when he got a message from Anjali who was planning a 3 month visit to Berlin to
                    meet her colleagues that lived there. They spent most of that summer together, on a whirlwind
                    adventure, full of train rides across Europe, Jayant ferrying Anjali on cargo bikes, and yes, a
                    couple of romantic nights in Paris where they first kissed.
                </p>

                    But the magical summer ended and gave way to two years of a long distance relationship as Anjali
                    returned to NYC and Jayant continued his life in Berlin. They would find ways to see each other
                    in-person every few months, including a magical couple of weeks in Goa - the inspiration for this
                    wedding's location.

                    They were finally reunited when Jayant moved back to the US and they found their first apartment
                    together - a sunlit, corner apartment, in a lovely little neighborhood in Brooklyn. Before long,
                    they realized that this was truly for forever and here we are!
