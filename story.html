                    Our paths first crossed as undergrads in the US, Anjali living an artistic life in Brooklyn,
                    Jayant being an engineering nerd in upstate New York. We would meet occasionally, when Jayant was
                    transiting through NYC or when the fellowship supporting their education would hold its annual
                    conference. We became fast friends, but never more.

                <p class="body">
                    Conversations and meetings were few and far between after undergrad. Anjali hit the hustle of the
                    design consultant world, chugging bad coffee, jet setting across the world. Jayant moved to the West
                    Coast, still studying and also chugging coffee but the hipster, funky kind.

                <p class="body">
                    The fateful reconnection is a tale as old as the modern European summer fling. Jayant was living and
                    working in Berlin when he got a message from Anjali who was planning a 3 month visit to Berlin to
                    meet her colleagues that lived there. We spent most of that summer together, on a whirlwind
                    adventure, full of train rides across Europe, Jayant ferrying Anjali on cargo bikes, and yes, a
                    couple of romantic nights in Paris where we first kissed.

                    But the magical summer ended and gave way to two years of a long distance relationship as Anjali
                    returned to NYC and Jayant continued his life in Berlin. We would find ways to see each other
                    in-person every few months, including a magical couple of weeks in Goa - the inspiration for this
                    wedding's location.

                <p class="body">
                    We were finally reunited when Jayant moved back to the US and we found our first apartment
                    together - a sunlit, corner apartment, in a lovely little neighborhood in Brooklyn. Before long,
                    we realized that we wanted to build a life together. Jayant first proposed to Anjali in Central
                    Park, by the lake, a spot Anjali had painted recently. Anjali, not to be outdone, proposed back
                    with a comic about our relationship, after a bike ride at the Storm King Art Center. Both proposals
                    culminate in this wedding, a celebration with you, our family.
